# MyAPI_Express_Backend

It's a personnal project to improve my self in backend new techologies (Mongo, GraphQL, Jest testing, Passport Local and thirdparty connection, Express session and custom middleware). It uses my own MongoDB cluster with a .env file. Soon I'll make to that this project will be usable for everyone.

## Passport Connection

My implementation is heavily inspired by this [article](https://medium.com/swlh/set-up-an-express-js-app-with-passport-js-and-mongodb-for-password-authentication-6ea05d95335c) an its [github repository](https://github.com/FBosler/fb-tutorial-social-login/tree/steps/3_backend_1).
